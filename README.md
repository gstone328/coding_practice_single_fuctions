#  Coding Practice for Single Functions #
A compilation of practice solving single function coding challenges




## Examples Ordering
Problems are organized by folder and each folder has a seperate file for each language the problem was solved in.


## Running Python Examples
Python examples are written in python3, and script can be executed with the python 3 interpreter

    `ex python3 'name_file.py'`


## Running  C++ Examples
C++ examples can be compiled and ran with the gpp compiler for c++14 or greater.

    compile and create executable
    `ex g++ -std=c++20 'name_of_file.cpp' -o 'name_of_executable'`

    run the executable
    `./'name_of_exectuable'`
